Java operators produce new values from one or more operands.  Operands are the things on the left and right sides of the operator.

In Java there are a few exceptional operators that come overloaded:

- ### The + operator can be used to add two numeric primitives together or to perform a concatenation operation if either operand is a String.
- ### The &, |, and ^ operators can all be uused in two different ways, although on this version of the exam, their bit-twiddling capabilities won't be tested. 

> ### Operators and assignments are a part of many questions dealing with other topics.
